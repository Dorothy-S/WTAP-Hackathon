PITCH:

MENTEES:
- Priorities: career path exploration, recommendations, advice from top professionals, extra learning resources, networking

MENTORS:
- Priorities: networking, efficiency of research, time management

INTRO:
- The number 1 concern that every mentee shares is joining the industry for the first time and finding yourself completely unprepared. Mentees could spend hours looking for professionals with advice on LinkedIn, self-directed courses, YouTube tutorials -- and they probably do. In our experience, the time spent looking for courses that are actually helpful, that are affordable, and that are industry-relevant in 2026 can take even longer than the course itself. Even worse, there is no guarantee that the courses will actually benefit you in your role once you actually begin, or whether you just wasted $50. When you're already struggling to keep up with courses, job applications, personal projects, and your own life, a platform combining all of these features into one convenient dashboard could save days of valuable time.

- As for mentors, you are some of the industry's top professionals volunteering your own time to help new prospects. A website saving you as much time and research as possible would be (perfect) for professionals who are busy enough
